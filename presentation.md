## Content

The presentation should have the following components:

- What problem does the app solve? Who does it solve it for?
- What are 1-2 things you learned?
  - You can focus on what you learned about programming as an art/craft/profession, not necessarily what specific technologies you learned to build the app.
  - Example: "I learned that the best way for me to learn is to try a tutorial out and break everything as I go!"
- What are 1-2 major features of the application, demoed from the eyes of a user?
- Optional: Exciting or interesting technologies you used
- Optional: Future enhancements

## Format

For your presentation,

- You may have slides, or no slides
- When demoing your app, you may either do a live-demo, or a silent video recording while you voice-over it

## Preparing for the Presentation

To prepare for the presentation, individually you should do the following:

- Dry run at least twice prior to the demo, in front of someone else
- Know the sequence of events that you will execute to show the features you want to demo
- Prepare slides for any non-app talking points
- Have a conversation about any equipment needs
  - If you have a special equipment need that requires more than plugging in your device, confirm with an instructor about the setup. Projects that have more involved setups may be encouraged to not perform a live demo, but to record a video instead
